# Rust Skills

[English](README.md) | [日本語](ja.md)

Rust Skills maintains and publishes Codex skills for Rust. Installable skills live
in [`skills/`](skills/); this README and the repository's GitHub Actions contain
maintainer documentation and automation procedures.

## Included skill

### `write-idiomatic-rust`

Use this skill to implement, modify, review, and refactor Rust code while
holding public APIs and internal implementations to the same quality bar. It
routes relevant decisions to Rust API Guidelines, Microsoft Pragmatic Rust
Guidelines, and Rust Design Patterns, covering naming, function and method
placement, types, ownership, error design, readability, and predictability.
The strict Clippy runner complements rather than replaces a project's own
Clippy command.

The crate guide is not a fixed list of recommended dependencies. It offers
examples to compare with the standard library, existing dependencies, and
small hand-written implementations. For example, `garde` may suit multi-field,
nested, or conditional validation for requests, forms, and configuration. Before
adopting any candidate crate, check the latest registry release and the official
documentation for the selected version, then match its API, features, MSRV, and
compatibility with the project's requirements.

## Setup

```bash
npx skills add azishio/rust-skills --skill write-idiomatic-rust
```

The `skills` CLI discovers the skill under `skills/` and installs all of its
tracked support files, including the required reference material. Use `--global`
to install it for every project, `--agent <agent>` to target a specific agent,
and `--copy` where symlinks are unsuitable.

## Maintainer setup

Clone the repository normally. The tracked reference files are ready for local
validation and are included in every `skills add` installation.

## Updating references

GitHub Actions vendors the required `src/` directories and license texts from
Rust API Guidelines, Microsoft Pragmatic Rust Guidelines, and Rust Design
Patterns every Monday. When changes exist, it records the exact source commits
in [`reference-sources.json`](reference-sources.json), then commits and pushes
them automatically. Use workflow dispatch for an intentional manual refresh.

## Layout

- `skills/`: distributable agent skills, each containing only execution
  instructions, agent reference material, and helper scripts.
- `.github/workflows/update-references.yml`: weekly reference update automation.
- `README.md` and `ja.md`: maintainer and user documentation in English and
  Japanese.
